## User Flow

1. **Visitor lands on `/`** -- ETHINX Launchpad (main marketing page)
2. **Explores public pages** -- `/showcase`, `/partners`, `/video-velocity`
3. **Takes the audit** -- `/onboarding` (Creator OS questionnaire)
4. **Signs up / logs in** -- `/login`, `/signup`
5. **Enters member area** -- `/dashboard` (Creator Growth Hub as main dashboard)
6. **Accesses tools** -- `/dashboard/curriculum` (Blueprint), `/dashboard/studio` (Neon Studio)
7. **Admin users** -- `/admin/*` (Command Center with full sidebar)

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation (this session)
Set up the unified app shell with routing, shared auth, and theme provider.

- **Unified App.tsx** with all route groups (public, member, admin)
- **Shared AuthProvider** and ProtectedRoute (adapted from Admin Command Center)
- **Shared ThemeProvider** with dark/light toggle
- **Shared layout components**: public Navbar, member DashboardLayout, AdminLayout

### Phase 2: Public Pages
Copy and adapt components from the 4 public-facing projects.

- **`/`** -- ETHINX Launchpad (hero, products, pricing, results, partners)
- **`/showcase`** -- ETHINX Showcase (case studies, results wall, activity feed)
- **`/partners`** -- ETHINX Partner Program (tiers, calculator, application form)
- **`/video-velocity`** -- Video Velocity (offer, order form, FAQ)

Each gets its own page file importing its original components, namespaced under folders (e.g. `src/components/launchpad/`, `src/components/showcase/`).

### Phase 3: Onboarding + Auth
- **`/onboarding`** -- Creator OS audit questionnaire (public, leads to signup)
- **`/login`**, **`/signup`**, **`/forgot-password`**, **`/reset-password`** -- Unified auth pages
- Supabase integration for auth + archetype_results storage

### Phase 4: Member Dashboard
- **`/dashboard`** -- Creator Growth Hub (stats, progress, week content, ad engine, community, support, email templates)
- **`/dashboard/curriculum`** -- Creator Blueprint curriculum view
- **`/dashboard/studio`** -- Neon Studio video generation tool
- **`/dashboard/adengine`**, **`/dashboard/templates`**, **`/dashboard/community`**, **`/dashboard/support`** -- Growth Hub sub-pages

### Phase 5: Admin Panel
- **`/admin`** -- Command Board
- **`/admin/clients`**, **`/admin/deployments`**, **`/admin/agents`**, **`/admin/workflows`**, **`/admin/revenue`**, **`/admin/content`**, **`/admin/support`**, **`/admin/settings`**
- AdminLayout with sidebar navigation (already built in Command Center)

### Phase 6: Supabase + Wiring
- Connect Lovable Cloud Supabase for database (tables from Admin Command Center schema)
- Wire up real data flows: questionnaire results, client management, support tickets, checkout/payments
- Role-based access (admin vs member) using a `user_roles` table

## Technical Details

- **Component namespacing**: Each project's components go into `src/components/{module}/` to avoid naming collisions (e.g. multiple HeroSections become `launchpad/HeroSection`, `showcase/HeroSection`, etc.)
- **Shared UI**: The `src/components/ui/` folder (shadcn) is already in this project and shared across all modules
- **Assets**: Images/fonts from each project will be copied via `cross_project--copy_project_asset`
- **Supabase types**: Merged from the Admin Command Center's 1100-line types file as the starting schema
- **Dependencies**: Some projects use `framer-motion`, `recharts`, `date-fns` -- these will be installed once in the unified project

## Execution Approach

Due to size, this will be built incrementally across multiple sessions. Phase 1 (foundation + routing shell) will be built first. Each subsequent phase copies components from the source projects, adapts imports, and wires them into the unified router.
